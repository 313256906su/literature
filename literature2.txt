To be or not to be,that's a question.

Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

When sorrows come, they come not single spies, - but in battalions.

There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

Let me be cruel, not unnatural; I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

Doubt thou the stars are fire

Doubt that the sun doth move

Doubt truth to be a liar

But never doubt my love.

Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes.

More matter with less art.

I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space.

Purpose is but the slave to memory, of violent birth, but poor validity.

There is a method in one's madness.

There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.

Frailty, the name is woman!

This above all: to thine self be true.

Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world!

It is not, nor cannot come to good. But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
